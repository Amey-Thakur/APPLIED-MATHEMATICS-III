## Overview

Applied Mathematics III (CSC301) is a core subject in the Second Year (Semester III) of the Computer Engineering curriculum at the University of Mumbai. This course builds upon foundational mathematical concepts and introduces advanced analytical methods crucial for engineering problem-solving.

### Course Topics

The curriculum encompasses several key mathematical domains:

- **Complex Variables**: Analytic functions, Cauchy-Riemann equations, contour integration, and residue theory
- **Laplace Transforms**: Transform methods for solving differential equations and system analysis
- **Fourier Transforms**: Frequency domain analysis and signal processing fundamentals
- **Z-Transforms**: Discrete-time signal analysis and digital system design
- **Statistical Methods**: Probability distributions, sampling theory, and hypothesis testing

### Repository Purpose

This repository represents a curated collection of study materials, reference books, question papers, and personal preparation notes compiled during my academic journey. The primary motivation for creating and maintaining this archive is simple yet profound: **to preserve knowledge for continuous learning and future reference**.

As I progress in my career, I recognize that mathematical foundations remain essential for solving complex engineering problems. This repository serves as my intellectual reference point: a resource I can return to for relearning concepts, reviewing methodologies, and strengthening understanding when needed.

**Why this repository exists:**

- **Knowledge Preservation**: To maintain organized access to comprehensive study materials beyond the classroom
- **Continuous Learning**: To support lifelong learning by enabling easy revisitation of fundamental mathematical concepts
- **Academic Documentation**: To authentically document my learning journey through Applied Mathematics III
- **Community Contribution**: To share these resources with students and learners who may benefit from them

All materials in this repository were gathered, organized, and documented by me during my undergraduate studies (2018-2022) as part of my coursework and exam preparation.
